# DAA_LAB-KIIT-

Welcome to the official repository for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Lab**. This repository contains well-structured code implementations, problem statements, and outputs for various algorithmic concepts taught in the DAA course.

## 📁 Contents

This repository includes:

- ✅ Code files for each lab problem (in C/C++ or preferred language)
- 📜 Problem statements for each exercise
- 🧮 Time and space complexity analyses (wherever applicable)
- 📌 Input/Output examples for better understanding

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Divide and Conquer (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Greedy Algorithms (e.g., Kruskal’s, Prim’s, Huffman Coding)
- Dynamic Programming (e.g., 0/1 Knapsack, Matrix Chain Multiplication)
- Backtracking (e.g., N-Queens, Graph Coloring)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
- Other foundational algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Heap Sort)

## 💻 Tools & Technologies

- Language: `C++` 
- IDE: Code::Blocks / VS Code
- OS: Windows / Linux
- Git for version control
